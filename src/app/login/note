   method to redirect
   1)navigateByUrl---method of Router class--used by create an object of router
 ----------------
      dependency injection--inorder to use a class inside another class--data sharing between two dependent classes--define that class in constructor
      while we need to create an object inside the constructor we need to give an axis specifier:-specify who can use it--in default it is public or we need to use private before reference of object

--------------------------------
Angular service--if we want to use any database redentently store it as angular services--here userdetails is to be used redentently      
     create angular service command:-
                         ng g s service_name 

                         here while we call api it is easy while it called in service or to add condition checking wee need to call where ever condition checked 
-------------------------------------                        

in if condition all thing otherthan false will become true



VALIDATION methods

it is to validate inputs--if it is username input it only accept username

it is angular form VALIDATION

2)model driven form--can be used easy through methods in validator class(predefined)--easy compared to template driven--form will create in ts file
  2.1)Reactive form--it should have;--in constructor of usig files ts file formbuilder

LOCAL STORAGE IN ANGULAR
     -setItem()
     -getItem()
     -removeItem()

CREATION OF USER DEFINED EVENTS
  -predifined events are click.mouse pointer
  -in order to create events we use eventEmitter class
  -then call its methods by creating objects of EventEmitter--to work that method we need to call emit() method
  -to call that event we need to call in selector of that file we called in any html



COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DIFF PORTs--data sharing--using cors (cross orgin resourse sharing)--between port of angular 4200 and server 3000--this installed in server


--import HttpClientModule--in app module
   --class name HttpClient--inside this module to create Http request


--http api request is asynchronous request so to solve asynchronous request in ts we use RxJs method--have chance of two observable will take more than 1 request at asynchronous req(instead of promise in javascript--only one request at one time) resolve and reject
  --resolve will use subscribe() method(instead of then in js)
  --reject will use catch() method
